Team Project AbbVie 2017
The project “Topic Monitoring in the Pharmaceutical Industry” consists of two goals: to get a better insight into the analysis of public’s opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions from social media platforms towards our client company - AbbVie Inc - and its competitors as well as the whole pharmaceutical industry; and to identify emerging topics in real-time and provide meaningful analytics that synthesize an accurate description of each topic.
