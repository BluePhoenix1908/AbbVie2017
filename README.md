# Topic Monitoring in the Pharmaceutical Industry 
Master Team Project at [University of Manhheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/1/english/) for M.Sc. Business Informatics and M.Sc. Data Science in Cooperation with AbbVie Inc.

The project “Topic Monitoring in the Pharmaceutical Industry”,  consists of two goals: to get a better insight into the analysis of public’s opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions from social media platforms, especially Facebook and Twitter, towards our client company - AbbVie Inc - and its competitors as well as the whole pharmaceutical industry; and to identify emerging topics in real-time and provide meaningful analytics that synthesize an accurate description of each topic.
